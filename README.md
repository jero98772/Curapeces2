Curapeces is an ongoing Python-based project designed for the self-diagnosis of fish health. Hosted on GitHub to maintain a comprehensive record of its development, Curapeces leverages a growing dataset, stored as variables within the codebase, with the ultimate objective of facilitating community-driven initiatives. While its current focus lies in the classification of images depicting diseased fish, Curapeces aspires to expand its functionality to support various open-source endeavors within the realm of fish-related projects. Acknowledging that it is a work in progress, Curapeces stands as a testament to continuous improvement, representing a commendable effort in both model development and project management.

The model is trained to classify the following fish diseases:


1. **Tumor and deformity attack**
2. **Polydactyly**
3. **Hydrocephalus and swim bladder**
4. **Holes in the head**
5. **Nopez (I couldn't find a direct translation, it seems like a term specific to a certain context)**
6. **Parasite in the mouth**
7. **Catfish burn**
8. **Gills**
9. **Lernea worm**
10. **Fungi**
11. **Ich white spot**
12. **Blind eye**
13. **Fin rot**
14. **Healthy**

## CuraPeces Dataset

The CuraPeces dataset is available in two versions:

1. **CuraPeces_Removed_background**: This dataset includes images with the background removed.
   - Dataset link: [CuraPeces_Removed_background](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jero98772/CuraPeces_Removed_background)

2. **CuraPeces_Background**: This dataset contains images with the original background.
   - Dataset link: [CuraPeces_Background](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jero98772/CuraPeces_Background)

## Purpose

The primary aim of these datasets is to improve the accuracy of training models, particularly for tasks related to fish species classification.
